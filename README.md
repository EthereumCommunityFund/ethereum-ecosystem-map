# ethereum-ecosystem-map
This repository is dedicated to collect and display resources that contribute to an objective mapping or overview of the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Background & Motivations
Sometimes, for both newcomers and seniors of the Ethereum community, it can be hard to keep track of the latest advances, as well as the latest conversations concerning research. At the same time, the community lacks access to a data-driven, objective mapping of the Ethereum ecosystem. 
From the ECF's perspective, we wish to build automated or semi-automated tools that
provide an objective overview of the state of the ecosystem, so community members can see in what layers, areas or tooling Ethereum is lacking. 
For grant managers at the ECF, this overview can be helpful for prioritising research and development in those areas that are essential but less attractive, distribute funding in a balanced manner, and strive for diversity of projects vertically along the stack, and horizontally, in terms of implementations. 

## Taxonomy (V.0.2)
Taxonomies are an useful way of presenting information in a visual and concise manner. Nonetheless, they are not perfect, as there will always be projects or cases that do not fit limitedly to one layer, as well as others that fit at the same time in more than one layer. 
For illustration purposes, the following is one of the first iterations of a taxonomy of projects in the ethereum ecosystem.

> Note that all the projects mentioned serve as examples only of each layer, *by no means are these mentions any kind of endorsement*.
